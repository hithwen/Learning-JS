Exercise: F1 races results

Like http://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2016/races/952/malaysia/race-result.html

Pick up the ones you prefer:
* Drivers, teams, nationalities…
* Race, Qualifying, Championship…
* Position, Time, Fastest lap, Last lap…

Suggestions:
* Use moment.js for timespans
* Don't use moment.js
* Sort by different data: qualification, race, fastest lap, championship…
* Add new data. Example:
* Add lap time for car X:34 laps @ 1:01:12   +   last lap 1:37   =   35 laps @ 1:02:49
* Play with immutability: don't modify, generate new object
* Use promises to fetch data (even local)
*  Write tests, like http://jsbin.com/mimovo/4/edit or http://jsbin.com/xicori/7/edit

Keep the exercise in jsbin
* If you want feedback, commit it to Github and open a PR
* As you get more skills on Webpack or others, set up a build task
